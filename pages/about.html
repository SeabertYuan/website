                    Hello my name is Seabert Yuan. I'm a student, content creator, and programmer based in Canada. I've spent all my life figuring out the world, chasing dreams, and finding my place here on Earth.
                    </p>
                    <p class="biographyParagraphs">
                    Since I can remember I've been swimming, despite never having the opportunity to swim competitively, I swim not just for leisure but to swim efficiently. Swimming has taken me to learn aquatics leadership and lifesaving skills.
                    </p>
                    <p class="biographyParagraphs">
                    In 2018, I picked up a badminton racquet and for the first time, played in a competitive team setting. I've never stopped playing since then.
                    </p>
                    <p class="biographyParagraphs">
                    With time to spare during the pandemic in 2020, I spent my time learning and polishing various skills: coding, photography, filmmaking, drawing, and storytelling among others I cannot recall. I've faced setbacks in finding time to continue practicing these skills. I've faced challenges with burnout and decreased motivation. I've faced failure in applying these skills. But while I might not be happy with where I am now, I know that I will continue to enjoy what I do so I can be happy with the progress I've made. The most valuable lesson I've learned these past 3 years, is that there is no such thing as an end; there are only breaks.
                    </p>
                    <p class="biographyParagraphs">
                        Going from a strict TLC (traditional learning centre) education program to the GATE (gifted and talented education) program, and finally to the IB (International Baccalaureate) program, I have been forced to focus on academics all my life. Yet, only recently have I began to truly enjoy the simple aspects of life. Relationships—with myself, with my friends, with my family, and with my significant other—were what I had neglected in the past. I have finally let myself live and I don't regret that. Sure I might not be at the top of the class, hell I might even be at the bottom, but that's okay sometimes because life is more than just numbers.
                    </p>
                    <p class="biographyParagraphs">
                        I do regret a lot of choices that I have made, but they only help to make me live in the present. Life is a great lesson and even if I fail I want to live with the least regrets. I've heard (or read) somewhere that regret from inaction is always worse than regret from action; I completely agree.
