					Why a Classic Disney Movie is Brilliant
					</h2>
				<h2>Seabert Yuan</h2>
				<p>
					I absolutely adore this film. I don't even know why, it's cliche or whatever but it's absolutely fantastic. The beast is lovable because of his imperfections. We understand that his shortcomings caused him to become more and more beastlike over time. It's absolutely amazing to watch him become more and more refined as he spends more time with Belle. The dance scene is wonderfully done. As well, the sacrifice made by the Beast at the end when he looks at the withering rose hurts so hard. We see a more soft character, it's so beautiful. I am crying ;-;. The Beast's sadness and despair is visible as if he has given up after losing his love. Upon seeing Belle, his renewal in strength shows his devotion to his love.
