			Introduction to My Articles
			</h2>
		<h2>Seabert Yuan</h2>
		<h3>What is this?</h3>
		<p>
			So what is this section? This is a section devoted for me to write about whatever, whenever, for no reason at all. I will write about a variety of subjects such as my life, my experiences, as well as reviews. The best part? Nobody will see this! I can be as cringey as I need be!
		</p>
		<h3>Why is it so ugly?</h3>
		<p>
			I am glad you asked! As the architects would say, "form follows function." Is that just an excuse for me not to do CSS? Maybe. Will I fix it? No. Maybe. If I get bored.
