					Introduction to My Articles

				<h2>Seabert Yuan</h2>
				<h3>What is this?</h3>
				<p>
					So what is this section? This is a section devoted for me to write about whatever, whenever, for no reason at all. I will write about a variety of subjects such as my life, my experiences, as well as reviews. The best part? Nobody will see this! I can be as cringey as I need be!
				</p>
				<h3>Why is it so ugly?</h3>
				<p>
					I am glad you asked! As the architects would say, "form follows function." Is that just an excuse for me not to do CSS? Maybe. Will I fix it? No. Maybe. (If I get bored)

				<h3>A shoutout to Anthony Gong.</h3>
				<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/polyhymniasveil">If you're interested.</a>
				<p>
					There's something magical about reading a brother's writing. There's this aspect of discovering an entire new dimension to them that makes reading their works so fascinating. I cannot lie, I had been chained down by ego and indifference, weighed down by the anchor of selfishness and pride, that I couldn't truly appreciate the cosmic force of the little, delicate words sprawled (or rather, carefully placed) across a page by someone who I can consider so close they're a part of me.
				</p>
				<p>
					It's interesting. But the reason I write this is to acknowledge his incredible writing. He has inspired me to do my own writing and to update this website. I am grateful for his words because sharing the language of the soul is one of my greatest fears and challenges.
				</p>
				<p>
					The way he uses language provokes thought and emotion. It provokes wonder, sorrow, and love. I have read his works many times now and just wish he would update his website with more.
				</p>
				<h3>A quick thought about the mind.</h3>
				<p>
					It's more powerful than we think. The placebo effect is well documented and well studied. But anecdotally, how I think changes my day from a lazy one, to a productive one. It changes my 3km run into a 5km run. The difference between winning a game and losing a game in badminton is literally how much you can convince yourself that playing is more fun than being pissed because of your ego.
